# Portfolio

I started creating a sample app with esbuild to familiarize myself with the API, but then decided to use this site for a simple portfolio. 

#### Todo/ideas:
- deploy
- Theme-switcher:
    - update to use icons
    - have detect browser theme
- Find a fun JS library to mess around with
- Use github API to pull repos, or at least some stats to show off in a charting library
- Think of good structure for different pages
- Setup favicon
- Add photo
